Stakinglab Coin
=====================

Intro
-----
Stakinglab Coin (LABX) is a sustainable cryptocurrency modeled after
Satoshi Nakamotoâ€™s vision for Bitcoin. It is a decentralized,
peer-to-peer transactional currency designed to offer a solution to the problem posed
by the exponential increase in energy consumed by Bitcoin and other proof-of-work currencies.
Proof-of-work mining is environmentally unsustainable due to the electricity used by
high-powered mining hardware. Stakinglab Coin utilizes an energy efficient proof-of-stake algorithm,
can be mined on any computer, and will never require specialized mining equipment.
